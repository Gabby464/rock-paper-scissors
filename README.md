# rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game. 

The Player will select their choice and the computer will randomly select theirs. From there they will both play until one of them reaches 5 points, and the player will be alerted of the winner of the whole game. The screen will update in writing: 
The current winner from the game-round;
The current score after the game-round;
The total game-rounds played;

Upon someone reaching 5 points, the player will be alerted and the button functionality will be removed. In order to play again, they will have to refresh the page (to be updated for better functionality).
